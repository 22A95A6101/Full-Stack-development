Knowledge has to expand or grow to remain knowledge. The road to excellence is toughest, roughest and steepest in the Universe. The world requires and honors only excellence. Available information has to be directed by wisdom and intelligence to create new knowledge. Promotion of creativity is the new role of education. <br><br>It is only through creative thinking that the present and future problems can be addressed to find dynamic solutions.
